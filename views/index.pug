                | "We always had it in our minds that we might somehow go into clothing—our family business was children's wear—and around 2009, we saw a need in the market for the vision that we had. We thought, Let's make a few shirts, a few pants, a few different things, and it ended up turning into a full collection. We had no idea what we were doing because we never worked anywhere and we'd never trained. The first few years we didn't really understand how things worked—the logistics, running a business, being a designer, having a mindset of how to not only build a brand but to build a business. It took us at least four or five seasons to figure it that out."

                | "The day-to-day operations of a startup that's moving really rapidly is challenging. We're a small team. We have nine employees. We should probably have fifteen. Like: we're too small for the size of our business, but the size of our business keeps growing that it's taking up all of our energy just to keep growing the size of the business."

                | "We need more capital to create more inventory because we can't satisfy the demand. The market is absorbing our inventory faster than we can make it, and we need to find a way to get ahead of the demand."
